            <section class="movement">
                <p>☛ Upendranath Brahma's leadership was pivotal in the Bodoland movement, which sought to establish a separate state for the Bodo people. The Bodos, once a dominant community in the Northeast, Bengal, Bihar, and Nepal, had lost their prominence over time. Various historical events, including the fall of Gobinda Chandra's kingdom and the assimilation of Bodos into other communities, led to a period of cultural and social decline.</p>
                <p>☛ The Plains Tribal Council of Assam initially voiced the aspirations of the Bodos and other tribes, advocating for an autonomous state called Udayanchal. However, political leaders often used the slogan for electoral purposes, failing to meet the expectations of the common people. By the second half of the 1980s, the desire for a separate state intensified, and Brahma, with his educational background and leadership skills, emerged as a key figure in the movement.</p>
